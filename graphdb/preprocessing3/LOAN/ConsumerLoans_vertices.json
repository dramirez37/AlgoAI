        "explanatoryNote": "Many lenders will only approve auto loans for vehicles (i.e., cars, trucks) that are a certain age (typically 5 years or less) due to depreciation of the value of the vehicle. Because an auto loan is a 'secured' type of loan, the vehicle that is being financed is used as collateral (i.e. if the borrower fails to repay the loan, the vehicle may be seized by the lender)."

Note that there are restrictions in the US on the nature of the property that may be used as collateral for a HELOC - it must be classified as a 1-4 family dwelling.
