The borrower is required to pay at least part of the card's outstanding balance each billing cycle, depending on the terms as set forth in the cardholder agreement. As the debt reduces, the available credit increases for accounts in good standing. These complex financial arrangements have ever-shifting terms and prices. A charge card differs from a credit card in that the charge card must be paid in full each month."
