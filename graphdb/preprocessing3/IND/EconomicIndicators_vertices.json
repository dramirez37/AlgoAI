The statistical structure is defined based on the operating structure and the accounting data produced by that entity. A given location may only need to publish revenues, whereas an operating unit (establishment) has employment statistics, etc. An establishment is defined as a producing unit at a single geographical location at which or from which economic activity is conducted and for which, at a minimum, employment data are available. In the case of a home-based business, the actual physical location would be specified as two distinct institutional units - as a household from a personal living and consumer perspective and as an establishment / operating unit due to the statistics required of the business."
