Base underlying may be high or low quality. Create the pool by buying or selling protection depending on hich way you want to go, e..g. have high quality funds, (borrowers), would sell protection. If low quality, would buy protection to improve quality. So risk is no longer bound to the funding. REVIEW: More likely this is a band of percentages (from and to); review and formalize.
