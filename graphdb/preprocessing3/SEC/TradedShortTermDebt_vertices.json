        "abbreviation": "REPO",
        "explanatoryNote": "Most repos are overnight transactions, with the sale taking place one day and being reversed the next day. Long-term repos - called term repos - can extend for a month or more. Usually, repos are for a fixed period of time, but open-ended deals are also possible. Reverse repo is a term used to describe the opposite side of a repo transaction. The party who sells and later repurchases a security is said to perform a repo. The other party - who purchases and later resells the security - is said to perform a reverse repo. While a repo functions like the sale and subsequent repurchase of a security, but the legal reality and the economic effect is that of a secured loan. This is a loan as the original owner retains the rights to the cashflows of the underlying security. Economically, the party purchasing the security makes funds available to the seller and holds the security as collateral. If the repurchased security pays a dividend, coupon or partial redemptions during the repo, the funds are returned to the original owner. The difference between the sale and repurchase prices paid for the security represent interest on the loan. Indeed, repos are quoted as interest rates. A repo always pays interest at maturity, i.e. there are no periodic interest payments.",

        "explanatoryNote": "A bill of exchange is a written agreement between two parties - the buyer and the seller - used primarily in international trade. The buyer or seller typically employs a bank to issue the bill of exchange due to the risks involved with international transactions. Bills of exchange can be transferred by endorsement, much like a check. They can also require the buyer to pay a third party - a bank - in the event that the buyer fails to make good on his agreement with the seller."

        "explanatoryNote": "Considered negotiable instruments with features of a time draft, bankers' acceptances are created by the drawer and provide the bearer with the right to the amount noted on the face of the acceptance on the specified date. Unlike traditional checks, bankers' acceptances function based on the creditworthiness of the banking institution instead of the individual or business acting as the drawer. Additionally, the drawer must provide the funds necessary to support the bankers' acceptance, eliminating the risk associated with insufficient funds on the part of the drawer.",
