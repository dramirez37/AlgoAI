A forward start option becomes active at a specified date in the future. The premium is paid in advance, while the time to expiration and the underlying security are established at the time the forward start option is purchased. If at the first settlement date the underlying security trades below the strike price of the option (for a call), then it expires worthless and resets to the price of the underlying security at the time of settlement. If at the end of the next settlement the underlying security trades above the new strike, the holder may elect to receive the difference between the market price of the underlying security and the strike price. Alternatively, the holder can let it ride to receive the sum of all payouts at maturity.
