They are financial instruments that allow the transfer of credit risk among market participants, potentially facilitating greater efficiency in the pricing and distribution of credit risk. In its most basic form, a CDS is a contract where a 'protection buyer' agrees to make periodic payments (the CDS 'spread' or premium) over a predetermined number of years (the maturity or term of the CDS) to a 'protection seller' in exchange for a payment from the protection seller in the event of default by a 'reference entity.' CDS premiums tend to be paid quarterly and are set as a percentage of the total amount of protection bought (the 'notional amount' of the contract). CDS maturities generally range from one to ten years, with the five-year maturity being particularly common.\" See  for more detail.",
