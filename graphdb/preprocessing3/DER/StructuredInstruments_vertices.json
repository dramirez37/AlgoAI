        "explanatoryNote": "In many cases, certificates do not give the investor the right to receive dividend distributions from the underlying stocks or other assets. For example: You buy a bonus certificate issued by your bank which is based on a stock that pays annual dividends. During the certificate's term, the bank holds the underlying stock and receives the dividends. At the end of the term, the bank pays the predefined bonus, even though the actual price of the stock is lower (but not below the protection threshold).Depending on the type of certificate, the exact terms and conditions, and the contract's expiry date, it is possible that the investor may receive the underlying asset instead of money at the end of the investment term. That is often the case with discount certificates based on stocks, for example, when their price sits below the predetermined cap. If the certificate's issuer becomes insolvent, the assets which underly the certificate are considered part of the issuer's liquid assets. This is in contrast to owning actual securities or shares in investment funds, as these are segregated assets which remain the property of the investor if the broker or custodian bank fails.",

If you compare all three structured product types with each other, you\u2019ll see that outperformance bonus certificates come up a bit short in terms of the characteristics of the other two forms. In other words, the disproportionate participation rate (outperformance) is usually somewhat lower than with a 'plain vanilla' outperformance certificate. This is because additional bonus protection has to be bought in order to structure the product properly. The same applies to the bonus dimension: because such a certificate still affords disproportionate participation, its downside protection level is more modest."
