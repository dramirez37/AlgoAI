"The incremental debt basket is available to borrowers and guarantors only; it cannot be used by non-guarantor entities to raise indebtedness. The size of the incremental debt basket varies depending on the size and creditworthiness of the credit group. The principle of a basket consists of allowing the borrower, up to a maximum determined amount, to make restricted payments, disposals or investments, or take on incremental debt. Commonly, a basket is expressed as subject to restrictions based on a fixed ('hard cap') amount (e.g., may not exceed EUR 5,000,000).",Entity,"The incremental debt basket is available to borrowers and guarantors only; it cannot be used by non-guarantor entities to raise indebtedness.
