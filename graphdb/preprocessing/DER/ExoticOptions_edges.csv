KnockInOption,"Assume an investor purchases a knock-in put option with a down Direction, with a barrier price of $90 and a strike price of $100. The underlying security is trading at $110, and the option expires in three months. If the price of the underlying security reaches $90, the option comes into existence and becomes a vanilla option with a strike price of $100. Thereafter, the holder of the option has the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price of $100, even though it is trading below $90. It is this right that gives the option value. The put option remains active until the expiration date, even if the underlying security rebounds back above $90. However, if the underlying asset does not fall below the barrier price during the life of the contract, the down-and-in option expires worthless. Just because the barrier is reached does not assure a profit on the trade since the underlying would need to stay below $100 (after triggering the barrier) in order for the option to have value.",core#example

DoubleBarrierOption,"Considered an exotic option, a double barrier option is a combination of two single barrier options, with one barrier above and one barrier below the current price of the underlying. It is a bet by the holder that the underlying asset will move significantly, in the case of a knock-in barrier option, or will move by a very small amount, in the case of a knock-out barrier option, over the life of the contract. Traders use these options when they have an opinion on volatility but not on the direction of the underlying asset's next price move. A barrier option is a type of option where the payoff, and the very existence of the option, depends on whether or not the underlying asset reaches a predetermined price.",explanatoryNote

ForwardStartOption,"Forward start options typically attempt to keep future strike prices at the money or near the money. In this way, the holder will have the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) the underlying asset in the future at or near the then-current market price. Knowing where the strike price will be in relation to the underlying's price makes it easier to come up with the premium (cost) of the option, which is also typically determined and paid at the initiation of the contract prior to the activation date. If, at the expiration date, the underlying trades below the strike price of the option (for a call), then it expires worthless. If the underlying is above the strike (for a call), then the holder exercises it and owns the underlying at the strike price. For a put option, if the underlying is below the strike price, the option has value and will be sold or exercised to realize a gain. If the underlying is above the strike price, the option will expire worthless. Typically, as with most options, the holder may sell the option if it is in the money and take the cash instead of exercising the option. Since it is an exotic option, the seller and buyer of the option may also agree to settle the option with cash instead of delivering the underlying.

LookbackOption,"As a type of exotic option, the lookback allows the user to 'look back,' or review, the prices of an underlying asset over the lifespan of the option after it has been purchased. The holder may then exercise the option based on the most beneficial price of the underlying asset. The holder can take advantage of the widest differential between the strike price and the price of the underlying asset. Lookback options do not trade on major exchanges. Instead, they are unlisted and trade over-the-counter (OTC). This type of option reduces uncertainties associated with the timing of market entry and reduces the chances the option will expire worthlessly. Lookback options are expensive to execute, so these advantages come at a cost.",explanatoryNote

ChooserOption,"For example, assume a trader wants to have an option position for the updated XYZ Inc. earnings release. They think the stock will have a big move, but they are not sure in which direction. The earnings release is in one month, so the trader decides to buy a chooser option that will expire about three weeks after the earnings release. They believe this should provide enough time for the stock to make a significant move if it is going to make one, and fully digest the earnings release. Therefore, the option they choose will expire in seven to eight weeks. The chooser option allows them to exercise the option as a call if the price of XYZ rises, or as a put if the price falls. At the time of the chooser option purchase, XYZ is trading at $28. The trader chooses an at-the-money strike price of $28 and pays a premium of $2 or $200 for one contract ($2 x 100 shares). The buyer can't exercise the option prior to expiry since it is a European option. At expiry, the trader will determine if they will exercise the option as a call or put. Assume the price of XYZ at the time of expiry is $31. This is higher than the strike price of $28, therefore the trader will exercise the option as a call. Their profit is $1 ($31 - $28 - $2) or $100. If XYZ is trading between $28 and $29.99 the trader will still choose to exercise the option as a call, but they will still be losing money since the profit is not enough to offset their $2 cost. $30 is the breakeven point on the call. If the price of BAC is below $28, the trader will exercise the option as a put. In this case, $26 is the breakeven point ($28 - $2). If the underlying is trading between $28 and $26.01 the trader will lose money since the price didn't fall enough to offset the cost of the option. If the price of BAC falls below $26, say to $24, the trader will make money on the put. Their profit is $2 ($28 - $24 - $2) or $200.",core#example

CliquetOption,"A cliquet is a series of forward start options, all related to each other. Each forward start option represents the advance purchase of a put, or call, option with an at-the-money (ATM) strike price to be determined at a later date, typically when the option becomes active. A forward start option becomes active at a specified date in the future. The premium is paid in advance, while the time to expiration and the underlying security are established at the time the forward start option is purchased. If at the first settlement date the underlying security trades below the strike price of the option (for a call), then it expires worthless and resets to the price of the underlying security at the time of settlement. If at the end of the next settlement the underlying security trades above the new strike, the holder may elect to receive the difference between the market price of the underlying security and the strike price. Alternatively, the holder can let it ride to receive the sum of all payouts at maturity. The main advantage of initiating a cliquet is, if an investor expects volatility to rise, they can lock in their profits at predetermined levels and thus maximize their overall portfolio return.",explanatoryNote

The call buyer agrees to pay the $4,000 now (September), even though the option doesn't activate till January. On January 1, assume the stock price is $400. The strike is set at $400, and an option is now a vanilla option with a June expiry. At the June expiry, assume XYZ is trading at $420. In this case, the option is worth $20 ($420 - $400 strike). If they settle in cash, the buyer receives $2,000, or if they exercise, they receive 100 shares at $400 and can keep them, or sell them at $420 to make $2,000. Notice that this still results in a loss for the buyer, since they paid $4,000 but are only receiving back $2,000. To make money on the call, the price of the underlying needs to move above the strike price plus the premium. Therefore, if the price moves up to $450 by expiration, the option is worth $50 ($450 - $400 strike), and the buyer receives $5,000. That's a net profit of $1,000 over their $4,000 cost. If the underlying is trading below the $400 strike at expiry, the call option expires worthless and the buyer's premium is lost ($4,000 profit to the seller).",core#example

AsianOption,option whose exercise terms involve a payoff determined by the average underlying price (either the strike price or the settlement price) of the underlying asset over a predetermined period,core#definition
AsianOption,"These options allow the buyer to purchase (or sell) the underlying asset at the average price instead of the spot price. There are various ways to interpret the word 'average,' and that needs to be specified in the options contract. Typically, the average price is a geometric or arithmetic average of the price of the underlying asset at discreet intervals, which are also specified in the options contract. Because of the averaging feature, Asian options reduce the volatility inherent in the option; therefore, Asian options are typically cheaper than European or American options. They are used by traders who are exposed to the underlying asset over some time, such as consumers and suppliers of commodities, etc.",explanatoryNote
BarrierOption,"option whose final exercise depends upon the path taken by the price of an underlying instrument, i.e., whose payoff depends on whether or not the underlying asset has reached or exceeded a predetermined price",core#definition

RainbowOption,"Better of n Assets This type of rainbow is similar to the best of n assets plus cash but with the exception that there is no possible cash payoff, and X is set to 0. With this in mind, a better of 2 assets rainbow is essentially a two-asset call option, with a payoff being: Rainbow = max[0, max(S1, S2)] Worse of n Assets Essentially the opposite to the better of n assets, with the payoff being on the asset with the lower value. We can give the payoff for this option on 2 assets as: Rainbow = max[0, min(S1, S2)]",core#example

CompoundOption,"Therefore, there are two strike prices and two exercise dates. They are available for any combination of calls and puts.
