"Lookback options are cash settled options, which means the holder receives a cash settlement at execution based on the most advantageous differential between high and low prices during the purchase period.

"A cliquet is a series of forward start options, all related to each other. Each forward start option represents the advance purchase of a put, or call, option with an at-the-money (ATM) strike price to be determined at a later date, typically when the option becomes active. A forward start option becomes active at a specified date in the future. The premium is paid in advance, while the time to expiration and the underlying security are established at the time the forward start option is purchased. If at the first settlement date the underlying security trades below the strike price of the option (for a call), then it expires worthless and resets to the price of the underlying security at the time of settlement. If at the end of the next settlement the underlying security trades above the new strike, the holder may elect to receive the difference between the market price of the underlying security and the strike price. Alternatively, the holder can let it ride to receive the sum of all payouts at maturity. The main advantage of initiating a cliquet is, if an investor expects volatility to rise, they can lock in their profits at predetermined levels and thus maximize their overall portfolio return.",Entity,"A cliquet is a series of forward start options, all related to each other.

"For example, assume a trader wants to have an option position for the updated XYZ Inc. earnings release. They think the stock will have a big move, but they are not sure in which direction. The earnings release is in one month, so the trader decides to buy a chooser option that will expire about three weeks after the earnings release. They believe this should provide enough time for the stock to make a significant move if it is going to make one, and fully digest the earnings release. Therefore, the option they choose will expire in seven to eight weeks. The chooser option allows them to exercise the option as a call if the price of XYZ rises, or as a put if the price falls. At the time of the chooser option purchase, XYZ is trading at $28. The trader chooses an at-the-money strike price of $28 and pays a premium of $2 or $200 for one contract ($2 x 100 shares). The buyer can't exercise the option prior to expiry since it is a European option. At expiry, the trader will determine if they will exercise the option as a call or put. Assume the price of XYZ at the time of expiry is $31. This is higher than the strike price of $28, therefore the trader will exercise the option as a call. Their profit is $1 ($31 - $28 - $2) or $100. If XYZ is trading between $28 and $29.99 the trader will still choose to exercise the option as a call, but they will still be losing money since the profit is not enough to offset their $2 cost. $30 is the breakeven point on the call. If the price of BAC is below $28, the trader will exercise the option as a put. In this case, $26 is the breakeven point ($28 - $2). If the underlying is trading between $28 and $26.01 the trader will lose money since the price didn't fall enough to offset the cost of the option. If the price of BAC falls below $26, say to $24, the trader will make money on the put.

"For example, assume that two parties agree to enter into a call forward start option on XYZ stock. It is September and they agree that the forward start option will activate on January 1 at the money. That means on January 1 the strike price for the option will be the price that stock is trading at on that day. The option will expire in June. The exact strike price is unknown, but the parties do know the strike and underlying's price will be the same at activation. They can look at current six-month options (January to June) and assess volatility to determine a premium for the option. They agree to trade one contract, equivalent to 100 shares of the underlying stock. They decide on a premium of $40, or $4,000 for the contract ($40 x 100 shares). The call buyer agrees to pay the $4,000 now (September), even though the option doesn't activate till January. On January 1, assume the stock price is $400. The strike is set at $400, and an option is now a vanilla option with a June expiry. At the June expiry, assume XYZ is trading at $420. In this case, the option is worth $20 ($420 - $400 strike). If they settle in cash, the buyer receives $2,000, or if they exercise, they receive 100 shares at $400 and can keep them, or sell them at $420 to make $2,000. Notice that this still results in a loss for the buyer, since they paid $4,000 but are only receiving back $2,000. To make money on the call, the price of the underlying needs to move above the strike price plus the premium. Therefore, if the price moves up to $450 by expiration, the option is worth $50 ($450 - $400 strike), and the buyer receives $5,000. That's a net profit of $1,000 over their $4,000 cost. If the underlying is trading below the $400 strike at expiry, the call option expires worthless and the buyer's premium is lost ($4,000 profit to the seller).",Entity,"For example, assume that two parties agree to enter into a call forward start option on XYZ stock. It is September and they agree that the forward start option will activate on January 1 at the money. That means on January 1 the strike price for the option will be the price that stock is trading at on that day. The option will expire in June. The exact strike price is unknown, but the parties do know the strike and underlying's price will be the same at activation. They can look at current six-month options (January to June) and assess volatility to determine a premium for the option. They agree to trade one contract, equivalent to 100 shares of the underlying stock. They decide on a premium of $40, or $4,000 for the contract ($40 x 100 shares).

Since the strike price is so close to zero, the investor purchasing the LEPO gains most of the features of owning the share directly with the major exceptions of dividends and voting rights.

"Forward start options typically attempt to keep future strike prices at the money or near the money. In this way, the holder will have the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) the underlying asset in the future at or near the then-current market price. Knowing where the strike price will be in relation to the underlying's price makes it easier to come up with the premium (cost) of the option, which is also typically determined and paid at the initiation of the contract prior to the activation date. If, at the expiration date, the underlying trades below the strike price of the option (for a call), then it expires worthless. If the underlying is above the strike (for a call), then the holder exercises it and owns the underlying at the strike price. For a put option, if the underlying is below the strike price, the option has value and will be sold or exercised to realize a gain. If the underlying is above the strike price, the option will expire worthless. Typically, as with most options, the holder may sell the option if it is in the money and take the cash instead of exercising the option. Since it is an exotic option, the seller and buyer of the option may also agree to settle the option with cash instead of delivering the underlying. Once a forward start option becomes active (strike price is set), then the option is valued like a vanilla option.",Entity,"Forward start options typically attempt to keep future strike prices at the money or near the money.
