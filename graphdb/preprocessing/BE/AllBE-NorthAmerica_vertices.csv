"The 'all' ontology for BE (North American Extension) is provided for convenience for FIBO users.  This ontology does not add new assertions, but imports most of the Production (Released) ontologies that comprise the FIBO Business Entities (BE) domain, including all of FND but excluding individuals for European governments and jurisdictions, and the related LCC region-specific ontologies. Note that the U.N. M49 Codes do not distinguish North and South America, and thus this ontology defines North America as the landmass north of the Panama-Colombia border (Northern America and Central America from an M49 code perspective), and the islands of the Caribbean (also identified as the Caribbean in the M49 subregion codes).  North American government entities and jurisdictions are provided for a subset of these countries and regions in FIBO 2.0, with the anticipation that additional entities will be added over time.",Entity,"The 'all' ontology for BE (North American Extension) is provided for convenience for FIBO users.
