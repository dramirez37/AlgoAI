,"This ontology defines high-level legal concepts for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These concepts include law and constitution, both of which are framed at a more abstract level than national or state laws and constitutions, so that law forms the basis both for statutes and for company by-laws, and constitution forms the basis both for national or state constitutions and for instruments which are constitutive of incorporated legal entities. This ontology also defines some of the variants of these such as governmental constitutions and ordinances. Court of Law is also defined here.",abstract

The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution (written or unwritten) and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics and society in countless ways and serves as a social mediator of relations between people.",explanatoryNote
