Right,"Rights dominate modern understandings of what actions are permissible and which institutions are just. Rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as many now see it. To accept a set of rights is to approve a distribution of freedom and authority, and so to endorse a certain view of what may, must, and must not be done. According to the Hohfeldian incidents (Wesley Hohfeld (1879-1918)), rights are complex and consist of four major components: privilege, claim, power, and immunity.",explanatoryNote
