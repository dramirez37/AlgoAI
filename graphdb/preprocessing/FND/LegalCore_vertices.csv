"Law is a term which does not have a universally accepted definition. Certain laws are made by governments, specifically by their legislatures although the sense intended here is broader. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution (written or unwritten) and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics and society in countless ways and serves as a social mediator of relations between people.",Entity,"Law is a term which does not have a universally accepted definition.
