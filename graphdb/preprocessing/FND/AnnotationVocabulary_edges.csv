The annotations extend properties defined in the OMG's Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary, in the Dublin Core Metadata Terms Vocabulary and in the W3C Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) Vocabulary, and have been customized to suit the FIBO specification development process. 

Note that any of the original properties provided in Dublin Core and SKOS can be used in addition to the terms provided herein. However, any Dublin Core terms that are not explicitly defined as OWL annotation properties in this ontology or in any of its imports must be so declared in the ontologies that use them.",abstract
