HomeEquityLineOfCredit,"Usually, the term of a HELOC can vary from 5 to up to 25 years, with an initial draw period during which the borrower can access the line of credit, followed by a repayment period during which monthly payments on principal and interest are due until the loan is paid in full. Note that there are restrictions in the US on the nature of the property that may be used as collateral for a HELOC - it must be classified as a 1-4 family dwelling. That determination is independent from the use of proceeds.",explanatoryNote

Because an auto loan is a 'secured' type of loan, the vehicle that is being financed is used as collateral (i.e. if the borrower fails to repay the loan, the vehicle may be seized by the lender).",explanatoryNote
