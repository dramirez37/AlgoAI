hasPrincipal,"This is not the balance of the debt at a point in time, but the amount drawn down at a specific point in time, after which (for interest bearing debts) interest becomes payable. Semantic Modeling note This term is over-ridden for specific kinds of debt (securities, loans) and is therefore not needed in any data model. It is included here to define part of the meaning of the Debt Finance term. It is a Relationship Fact and strictly speaking should be regarded as being specialized and over-ridden by the terms in the Loan and Security classes, however it is modeled here as a ""Referenceable Archetype"" meaning that it appears in diagrams as a textual entry not a relationship line, and so it is not possible to formally show this specialization.",core#editorialNote
