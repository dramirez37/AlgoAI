DowJonesIndustrialAverageBasket,"The Averages Committee, which includes the managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, the head of Dow Jones Indexes research, and the head of CME Group research, determine which components become a part of the DJIA. There are no set rules the Averages Committee must follow when selecting Dow components, only broad parameters to ensure those companies represent a large portion of the overall economic performance in the United States. Each average is reviewed at least once annually, but composition changes are rare for the sake of continuity. Since its beginnings in May of 1896, the Dow Jones stocks list has only changed 54 times. As of June 2018, the last remaining company of the original 12 components of the DJIA, General Electric (GE), was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance.",hasSelectionCriteria
