Base underlying may be high or low quality. Create the pool by buying or selling protection depending on hich way you want to go, e..g. have high quality funds, (borrowers), would sell protection. If low quality, would buy protection to improve quality. So risk is no longer bound to the funding. REVIEW: More likely this is a band of percentages (from and to); review and formalize.

SyntheticDebtSPV,"REVIEW: Whether this is (or is ever) a separate SPV for Synthetics, as it is for Cash CDO and other Cash structured finance. If not, how to define the facts at the level of SPV without contradictions. Moving stuff off the balance sheet is involved in putting it into the SPV. So talking a bout balance sheet or off balanc sheet, this is about creating the pool which is going to be sold off. This applies whether hte pool is cash (real holdings) or synthetics. Either way ,the instruments are transferred into the CPV to sell them off. conclusion: applies to cash and non cash. In the old days there were all sorts of guarantees added to that SPOV. Now if you provide support to that =SPV it is no longer ""Off balance sheet"" froma regulatory point of view. Accounting rules refer.",core#editorialNote

SyntheticCDOPortfolio,Review notes: What real stuff is this made of? Would be the actual contracts (the Ref Obligation contracts or the CDS contract)? Buyer of protection is buying protection and paying a fee. Similar to shorting on a stock. Seller of the protection is the one creating the instruments. So the Protection Seller is using the synthetic CDO as some kind of synthetic vehicle. Inside the portfolio is the actual contract that generates the cash.,core#editorialNote
