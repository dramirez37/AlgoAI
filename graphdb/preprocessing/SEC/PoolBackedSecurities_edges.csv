AssetBackedSecurity,"An asset-backed security (ABS) is a type of financial investment that is collateralized by an underlying pool of assetsâ€”usually ones that generate a cash flow from debt, such as loans, leases, credit card balances, or receivables. It takes the form of a bond or note, paying income at a fixed rate for a set amount of time, until maturity. ABS are financial securities backed by income-generating assets such as credit card receivables, home equity loans, student loans, and auto loans. Pooling assets into an ABS is a process called securitization. One difference between an ABS and a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is that the CDO issuer is generally a special purpose vehicle (SPV) or trust.",explanatoryNote

PrepaymentSpeed,"A prepayment model is used to estimate the level of prepayments (speed) on a loan portfolio that will occur in a set period of time, given possible changes in interest rates. Understanding prepayment speed is critical in assessing the value of mortgage pass-through securities. Prepayment models are based on mathematical equations and usually involve the analysis of historical prepayment trends to predict what will happen in the future. Prepayment models are often used to value mortgage pools such as GNMA securities or other securitized debt products, including mortgage-backed securities (MBS).",explanatoryNote

WeightedAverageCoupon,"The weighted average coupon (WAC) is calculated by taking the gross of the interest rates owed on the underlying mortgages of the MBS and weighting them according to the percentage of the security that each mortgage represents. The WAC represents the average interest rate of different pools of mortgages with varying interest rates. In the weighted average calculation, the principal balance of each underlying mortgage is used as the weighting factor. To calculate the WAC, the coupon rate of each mortgage or MBS is multiplied by its remaining principal balance. The results are added together, and the sum total is divided by the remaining balance. A mortgage-backed security's current WAC can differ from its original WAC as the underlying mortgages pay down at different speeds. In the weighted-average calculation, the principal balance of each underlying mortgage is used as the weighting factor.",explanatoryNote

StructuredFinanceInstrument,"Structured finance instruments represent a form of securitization technology which can be defined by three key characteristics: (1) pooling of financial assets, such as loans, bonds, or credit-default swaps; (2) de-linking of the credit risk of the asset pool from the credit risk of the originating firm, usually through use of a finite-lived, stand-alone special purpose vehicle (SPV); and (3) issuance by the SPV of ""tranched"" liabilities backed by the asset pool. Structured finance instruments are typically presented to large financial institutions or companies with complicated financing needs that are unsatisfied with conventional financial products.",explanatoryNote
