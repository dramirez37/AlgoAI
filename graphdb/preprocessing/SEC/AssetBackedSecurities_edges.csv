AutoAssetBackedSecurity,"Auto asset-backed securities (auto ABS) are typically structured finance securities that are collateralized by auto loans or leases, such as those to prime (good credit standing) and subprime (poor credit standing) borrowers. Loans or leases are bundled into pools and transferred to a special-purpose entity (SPE), which, in turn, transfers the pool to a (bankruptcy remote) trust. Payments on the underlying auto loans and leases are pooled in the trust, and the funds are used to pay note investors their respective principal which, in turn, transfers the pool to a (bankruptcy remote) trust, i.e., one that protects the security from bankruptcy. Payments on the underlying auto loans and leases are pooled in the trust, and the funds are used to pay note investors their respective principal and interest when due. Any leftover funds - known as excess spread, or the net interest margin - are paid to the equity holder (usually the issuer, such as an auto finance company).",explanatoryNote

StudentLoanAssetBackedSecurity,"The main purpose behind Student Loan ABS is to diversify the risk for lenders across many investors. By pooling and then packaging the loans into securities and selling them to investors, agencies can spread around the default risk, which allows them to give out more loans and larger loans. This way, more students have access to loans, investors have a diversifying investment instrument, and lenders can generate consistent cash flow from their securitization and debt collection services.",explanatoryNote
