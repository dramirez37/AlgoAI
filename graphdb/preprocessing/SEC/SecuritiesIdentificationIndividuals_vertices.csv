"A Refinitiv Instrument Code (RIC), previously known as the Reuters Instrument Code, is a proprietary identifier used by Refinitiv (now LSEG Financial Solutions) to represent financial instrument related data. The composition of a RIC is dependent on the type of instrument.

- Instrument code : Can be based on the exchange ticker code, ISIN or local code, currency code, and so on
- Period or time interval : Can be an expiry month code for example
- Delimiter : Usually a full stop used to separate the instrument code from the exchange code or a = sign for money securities.
- Source code : Usually a single or double alpha-character capital unique to an exchange

An equity RIC has several components: the Equity RIC root is in upper case, brokerage characters in lower case (if applicable), and finally an exchange identifier. These codes facilitate information lookup across various financial networks. The concept of RICs traces back to the Quotron service, which Thomson Reuters acquired in the 1980s. The division was spun out as Refinitiv in 2018. Refinitiv was acquired by the London Stock Exchange Group in 2021, and the organization was rebranded as LSEG Financial Solutions in 2023, though the name of the code and certain other branded concepts were retained.",Entity,"A Refinitiv Instrument Code (RIC), previously known as the Reuters Instrument Code, is a proprietary identifier used by Refinitiv (now LSEG Financial Solutions) to represent financial instrument related data.
