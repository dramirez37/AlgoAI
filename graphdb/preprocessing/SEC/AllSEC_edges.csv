,"The 'all' ontology for SEC is provided for convenience for FIBO users. This ontology does not add new assertions, but imports most of the Production (Released) ontologies that comprise the FIBO Foundations (FND), Business Entities (BE), Financial Business and Commerce (FBC), Indices and Indicators (IND), and Securities (SEC) domains, excluding most individuals for governments and jurisdictions (aside from those used in depositary receipts), financial services, regulatory organizations and related registries, and reference individuals, as well as the LCC region-specific ontologies.",explanatoryNote
