"For an unsponsored ADR, a depositary entity can issue certificates when there's heavy demand from investors for ownership in a specific company from abroad. The issuing entity is normally a broker-dealer that owns common stock in the company. Because they're issued without the consent or cooperation of the foreign company, unsponsored ADRs generally trade over-the-counter (OTC)—rather than on a stock exchange. Also, shareholder benefits and voting rights may not be extended to the holders of these particular securities. Many large global corporations use unsponsored ADRs to attract American capital. For example, American investors can invest in Royal Mail PLC, a postal and delivery service company from the United Kingdom that was founded by Henry VIII. The company's unsponsored ADR trades OTC under the ticker symbol ROYMY.",Entity,"For an unsponsored ADR, a depositary entity can issue certificates when there's heavy demand from investors for ownership in a specific company from abroad.
